# AI-Generated Guidebooks

A curated collection of comprehensive guides, playbooks, and research documentation generated through AI collaboration, maintained by Tushar.

## Overview

This repository serves as a personal knowledge library containing in-depth technical guides and research documentation across various domains of interest. Each guide is carefully crafted through AI-assisted research and writing, providing detailed explanations, practical examples, and actionable insights.

### Repository Philosophy

- **Content-First**: This repository exclusively contains markdown documentation and related assets (images, diagrams, etc.). No code files are included to maintain focus on knowledge sharing.
- **Quality over Quantity**: Each guide is comprehensive, well-structured, and thoroughly researched.
- **Living Documentation**: Content is continuously refined and expanded as new information becomes available.
- **Organized Growth**: As the library expands, content will be systematically organized into topic-specific directories.

## Current Guidebooks

| # | Guide | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | [Python Infrastructure Libraries](1_Python_Infrastrcuture_Libraries.md) | Comprehensive overview of Python infrastructure and tooling libraries |
| 2 | [MCP Complete Guide](2_MCP_Complete_Guide.md) | Complete guide to the Model Context Protocol |
| 3 | [FastMCP vs MCP TPM Guidebook](3_FastMCP_vs_MCP_TPM_Guidebook.md) | Comparative analysis of FastMCP and MCP TPM implementations |
| 4 | [YouTube MCP Server Guide](4_YouTube_MCP_Server_Guide.md) | Guide to building and using YouTube MCP servers |

## Repository Structure

Currently, guides are organized with numerical prefixes for easy reference. As the collection grows, content will be organized into thematic directories:

```

├── README.md
├── python/
│   └── infrastructure-libraries.md
├── protocols/
│   ├── mcp-complete-guide.md
│   └── fastmcp-vs-mcp-tpm.md
├── integrations/
│   └── youtube-mcp-server.md
└── assets/
    └── images/
```

## Topics of Interest

This knowledge base covers (and will continue to expand into):
