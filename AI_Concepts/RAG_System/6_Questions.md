# Key Questions for understanding RAG System

## RAG concept and systems

- What are audit trails and source verification in RAG Ai systems. How does this happen, both in conceptual and technical architecture terms. Why it is crucial and major things to consider while doing this.

- What is the importance of traditional data for metadata when storing vectors for RAG. what is the technical architecture to do that and what are key considerations while implementing this.

- what is the role of Amazon Bedrock in managing embedded models. what are the crucial aspects while dealing with this situations.

- WHy do I need to used GraphQL APIs while dealing with complex RAG queries. what is the underlying impact and How it helps in fulfilling the goals.

- what kind of guardrails are present dueing pre-processing of queries. Is there a common repository or source where guardrails are listed, present or suggestions are available. exactly where guardrails are need to be implemented.

- What alternative algorithms are present apart from K-nn search. what are the pros and cons of each such algorithm. How normal knn search can be improved not by coding but by tweating the technical architecture.

- Learn a great deal about Horizontal scaling especially of AWS Lambda, Opensearch clusters and other crucial aws services

- Just read about Facebook AI similarity search. seems interesting on how they are doing fast indexing, where exactly facebook is using this tech.

- Focus on guardrails. Whart are some common guardrails I need to focus during implementation. Is there a common document on guardrails, where and how they are used. what specific instructions must be followed while focussing on guardrails.

- Types of Guardrails: Input Guardrails, Retrieval Guardrails, Output Guardrails

- PII redaction techniques and guardrails is very important features of AI development
